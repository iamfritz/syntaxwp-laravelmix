        <h1 class="Demo__title">WP Laravel Mix Theme Boilerplate</h1>

        <p>This is a just a very minimalistic theme boiler that gets you started with Laravel Mix for building your
            project assets.</p>

        <h2>Why use Laravel Mix?</h2>

        <p>Simply put, it is a very straight-forward and easy to use wrapper for webpack that removes the need for
            a lot of the configuration that we would normally have to go through when using alternatives.</p>

        <p>For a sense of how simple it is to set up, check out the webpack.mix.js file in the them root.

		// no context-specific functionality â€“ the simply render data handed to them as follows:
		\WPLMixTheme\View::render( 'DemoView', [
			'title' => 'Who am I?',
			'text' => 'My name is Fritz and I build themes and plugins for WordPress. Contact me <a href="mailto:link4anything@gmail.com" target="_blank">link4anything@gmail.com</a>',
