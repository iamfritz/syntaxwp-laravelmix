        <h1 class="Example__title">WP Laravel Mix Theme Boilerplate</h1>

        <p>This is a WP Theme boiler that gets you started with Laravel Mix for building your
            project assets.</p>

        <h2>Why use Laravel Mix?</h2>

        <p>Simply put, it is a very straight-forward and easy to use wrapper for webpack that removes the need for
            a lot of the configuration that we would normally have to go through when using alternatives.</p>

        <p>For a sense of how simple it is to set up, check out the webpack.mix.js file in the them root.

		// You may use 'views' to render your UI components. Views are designed for use anywhere as they, ideally, have
		// no context-specific functionality â€“ the simply render data handed to them as follows:
		\WPLMixTheme\View::render( 'ExampleView', [
			'title' => 'Who am I?',
			'text' => 'My name is Phil Kurth and I build themes and plugins for WordPress. You can learn more about me at <a href="https://philkurth.com.au/" target="_blank">philkurth.com.au</a>',
